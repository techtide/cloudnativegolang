Using Go, gRPC, Docker, Kubernetes, and Cirrus CI

That Cirrus CI test really shouldn't be passing, as I haven't found a way for me to allow Cirrus CI to test endpoints, since the endpoints are not running on their end, and aren't running at all.

The Releases tab on GitHub contains a link to download the client script, which connects to the API when it is running on the local machine, as per the instructions.

API will take two numbers and do a combinatorics function, just as an example:

* ``/choose/5/3`` is 5 choose 3, the value of which is 10.

* ``/pick/5/3`` is 5 pick 3, the value of which is 60.

The reason this was picked is because I couldn't think of anything else.
