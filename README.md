Using Go, gRPC, Docker, Kubernetes, and Cirrus CI

API will take two numbers and do a combinatorics function, just as an example:

* ``/choose/5/3`` is 5 choose 3, the value of which is 10.

* ``/pick/5/3`` is 5 pick 3, the value of which is 60.

The reason this was picked is because I couldn't think of anything else.
